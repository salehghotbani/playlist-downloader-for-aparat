# Playlist Downloader for Aparat

Available for Firefox 140+, Google Chrome 123+ and Microsoft Edge 123+.

Downloads every video of an Aparat playlist, in playlist order, into
`Downloads/Aparat/<playlist title>/NN - <video title>.mp4` (NN is zero-padded: 2 digits, 3 from 100 videos, 4 from 1000).

## Install in Firefox
Quick test (removed when Firefox restarts):
1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on** and pick `manifest.json` from the source folder or the generated `dist/firefox` folder. A Firefox release ZIP also works.

## Install in Chrome or Edge

Generate the browser folders with Node.js 20 or newer:

```sh
npm run build
```

1. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome or `edge://extensions` in Edge.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select `dist/chrome` or `dist/edge`, respectively.

If using a release ZIP, extract it first and select the extracted folder containing `manifest.json`.
Keep that folder in place while the extension is installed. After updating the files, click **Reload** on the extensions page.
The source folder's root manifest is for Firefox; Chrome and Edge must use their generated folders.

## Use
Click the toolbar icon (on an Aparat playlist page the link is filled in for you), or paste a link such as
`https://www.aparat.com/playlist/1301084/`, then **Load playlist** and **Download selected**.
Keep the tab open while it runs. **Stop** cancels pending link requests, retry waits and active downloads.
Clicking **Download selected** again retries unfinished videos; completed files and videos with downloads disabled are skipped.
The link field accepts Aparat playlist URLs, video URLs with a `playlist` query parameter, or a numeric playlist ID (including Persian digits).

## Languages
English and Persian (RTL). The extension starts in Persian. The globe button next to the theme button switches language, and the choice is remembered from then on.
- UI strings: `locales/en.json`, `locales/fa.json` (flat key -> text, `{placeholders}`, plurals as `key.one` / `key.other`).
- Store listing name/description/tooltip: `_locales/<code>/messages.json`.
- To add a language: add `locales/<code>.json`, `_locales/<code>/messages.json`, and one entry in `LANGS` in `i18n.js`
  (set `dir` to `rtl` or `ltr`, and `digits` to its digit characters, or `null`).
  Missing keys fall back to English. Clicking the globe cycles through the languages in `LANGS`.

## Font
`fonts/Vazirmatn-VariableFont_wght.ttf` (Vazirmatn, SIL Open Font License 1.1, see `fonts/OFL.txt`).
One variable file covers all weights. Replace it with your own copy using the same file name if you like.

## Icon
Replace the PNGs in `icons/` with your own, keeping the names: `icon-16.png`, `icon-32.png`, `icon-48.png`, `icon-128.png`
(Chrome does not accept SVG for extension icons). Then reload the add-on.
UI icons are from Lucide (https://lucide.dev, ISC license), inlined in `app.html`.

## What it does and doesn't do
- Permissions: `downloads`, and API access to `www.aparat.com`. Video files and thumbnails are fetched from Aparat's CDN hosts. No analytics or telemetry is included.
- Skips videos whose uploader disabled downloads.
- Download links are signed and expire within hours, so each one is requested just before its download.
- Two videos download at a time. Aparat rate-limits its API, so don't raise this much.
- If Aparat returns fewer videos than the playlist's reported count, the app shows a warning; only returned videos are available.
- API requests time out after 30 seconds. Video failures are retried up to three times; Stop also interrupts the retry delay.

## Development checks

No runtime dependencies or bundler are required. With Node.js 20 or newer, run `npm test`.
The tests cover URL and response parsing, file names, quality selection, request cancellation and timeouts,
download event races, queue concurrency and selection state under both `browser` and `chrome` namespaces,
language switching, toolbar actions, and generated browser packages.
Browser download APIs are simulated in these tests; validate real downloads by loading the appropriate browser build as described above.

`npm run build` creates `dist/firefox`, `dist/chrome` and `dist/edge` with only runtime files, assets and a browser-specific manifest.
Use `npm run build:firefox`, `npm run build:chrome` or `npm run build:edge` to generate one target.
Firefox keeps its background scripts and Gecko settings; Chrome and Edge use a Manifest V3 service worker.
The minimum Chromium version reflects the UI's use of the `light-dark()` CSS function.
To prepare a release ZIP, zip the contents of the target folder with `manifest.json` at the archive root.
Publishing through browser stores is a separate step.
